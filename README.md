# Building HTM Systems

See website at [http://htmtheory.org](htmtheory.org) for now. This is a work in progress. Very early stages. 

This uses webpack to package some custom visualization libraries we uses for displaying HTM systems. It packages up binaries in bundles for use on the website above, to show interactive widgets.
