    The Thousand Brains Model of Intelligence suggests we need to rethink how the entire neocortex processes information. In the classic view, the cortex receives input from a sensory organ and processes it in a series of hierarchical steps. Sensory input ascends from region to region, and at each level, cells respond to larger areas and more complex features of a sensory array. Itâ€™s commonly assumed that complete objects can only be recognized at a high enough level in the hierarchy where cells can take in the entire sensory array.

        <p>
        In the Thousand Brains Model of Intelligence, each column creates complete
        models of its world, based on what it can sense as its associated sensor
        moves. Connections in the cortex, both hierarchical connections and
        connections between adjacent columns, allow columns to work together to
        quickly identify objects.
