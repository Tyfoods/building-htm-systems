Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence:

  desc: >
    <p>The <strong>Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence</strong> proposes that rather than learning one model of an object or concept, the brain builds many models of the same thing. Each model is built in a different way – with different types of inputs from different senses or from different parts of the same sensors. The models vote together to reach a consensus on what they are sensing, and the consensus vote is what we perceive. It’s as if your brain is thousands of brains working simultaneously.    </p>
    <p>The Thousand Brains Theory suggests we need to rethink how the cortex processes information.  Rather than extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, where objects are recognized as you ascend the hierarchy, our theory suggests a more distributed model.

    Local Computations / Parallel Voting:
      desc: >
        <p>In the Thousand Brains Theory, each cortical column creates complete models of its world, based on what it can sense as its associated sensor moves. Columns combine sensory input with a grid cell-derived location, and then integrate those “sensory features at locations” over movements. Long-range connections in the cortex allow columns to vote and this parallel voting leads to a consensus of what they the columns are sensing

    Common Cortical Circuit:
      desc: >
        <p>The neocortex is complex. It contains dozens of cell types, numerous layers, and intricate connectivity patterns. The connections between cells suggest a columnar flow of information across layers as well as a laminar flow within some layers. Fortunately, this complex circuitry is remarkably preserved in all regions. Vernon Mountcastle was the first to propose that a canonical circuit consisting of cortical columns underlies everything the neocortex does. The way we see, feel, hear, move, and even do high level planning runs on this same common cortical circuit.</p>

        <p>If we can understand how this <strong>common cortical circuit</strong> works, we will have a framework for understanding how the entire neocortex works. Understanding the function of cortical columns is a central goal of our research program.</p>

        Layers:
          desc: >
            <p>While neuroscience textbooks generally list 6 <strong>layers</strong> in the neocortex, scientists now believe there are more, with dozens of different cells types.  Our work involves figuring out what each layer is doing and how it fits into the common cortical circuit.</p>

        Connections Between Layers:

        HTM Neuron:
          desc: >
            <p>Much of our research focuses around one fundamental observation: that the neocortex is constantly predicting its inputs. The <strong>HTM neuron</strong> is based on the idea that every pyramidal cell is a prediction machine. A single pyramidal neuron with active dendrites can recognize hundreds of unique patterns and contexts in which it can predict its input.</p>

            <p>Columns combine sensory input with a grid cell-derived location, and integrate those “sensory features at locations” over movements.  Every sensation we perceive is processed relative to its <strong>location</strong> on an object, not relative to you.</p>

        Grid Cells:
          desc: >
            <p>A <strong>grid cell</strong> is a type of neuron that exists in the entorhinal cortex and is responsible for navigation and knowing where you are in the world. Recent experimental evidence suggests that grid cells also are present in the neocortex. We propose that the neocortex uses “<strong>cortical grid cells</strong>” to learn complete models of objects in the same way that the entorhinal cortex uses <strong>grid cells</strong> to learn the structure of environments.</p>

            <p>We propose the existence of a new type of neuron that is an extension of grid cells, called <strong>displacement cells</strong>. Displacement cells enable us to learn how objects are composed of other objects, also known as object compositionality.</p>

        Object Behavior:
          desc: >

            <p>We propose that learning an object’s behavior is learning a sequence of displacements, meaning a sequence of how the relative positions of two locations change over time.</p>

    Abstract Objects and Concepts:
      desc: >

        <p>Mountcastle proposed that all regions of the neocortex have the same complex circuitry and therefore they must be doing the same thing. If the regions of the neocortex that process sensory input use grid cells and locations to learn objects, then the evidence strongly suggests that the regions of the neocortex that learn <strong>abstract objects and concepts</strong> like language or mathematics also use grid cells and locations to perform these functions.</p>

        <p>We don’t fully understand how high-level concepts and abstract objects are represented in the brain, and are exploring this area further.</p>
