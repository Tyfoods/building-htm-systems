In the classic view, the cortex receives input from a sensory organ and processes it in a series of hierarchical steps. Sensory input ascends from region to region, and at each level, cells respond to larger areas and more complex features of a sensory array. Itâ€™s commonly assumed that complete objects can only be recognized at a high enough level in the hierarchy where cells can take in the entire sensory array. </p>\n",
