    The Thousand Brains Model of Intelligence suggests we need to rethink how the entire neocortex processes information. In the classic view, the cortex receives input from a sensory organ and processes it in a series of hierarchical steps. Sensory input ascends from region to region, and at each level, cells respond to larger areas and more complex features of a sensory array. Itâ€™s commonly assumed that complete objects can only be recognized at a high enough level in the hierarchy where cells can take in the entire sensory array.
